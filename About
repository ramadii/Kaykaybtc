Purple tokens are obtained through a different method in both CTR, CNK and Nitro-Fueled. 
After defeating the boss of a planet/area, the area's battle arena is unlocked, where players need to collect all of the crystals in the arena before time runs out. 
Doing so awards a purple token.
Collecting all these tokens awards the player with a bonus battle arena in CNK.
